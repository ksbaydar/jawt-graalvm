== Quick start
This sample derived from https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk11/blob/master/src/java.desktop/share/native/include/jawt.h 

Describe GraalVM and your environment:

GraalVM version: graalvm-ee-java11-22.3.0
JDK major version: 11
OS: Redhat Enterprise Linux 8.5 
Architecture: AMD64


Just a minimal AWT application to obtain native image. I can produce native image but when I run it it fails with JAWT_LOCK_ERROR. 
After getting successfully awt_DrawingSurface data, it fails.

There might be due to unsupported usage of Component.Peer class.  


=== Play with the samples
NOTE: read Makefile to compile,run 

gmake run-native
